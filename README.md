# whether_sweater

Sweater weather.... I mean, Whether Sweater is an application that allows you the user to plan a road trip. In doing so, as long as it is a viable destination, you will be able to see the origin city, the destination city, travel time, and estimated weather in the destination city upon arrival.

<p>Through this project the following learning goals were achieved:
  * Consumption of multiple API's
